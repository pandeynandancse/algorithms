If we take a closer look, we can observe that the statements in inner loop are executed O(V+E) times (similar to BFS). 
The inner loop has decreaseKey() operation which takes O(LogV) time. 
So overall time complexity is O(E+V)*O(LogV) which is O((E+V)*LogV) = O(ELogV) (For a connected graph, V = O(E))
