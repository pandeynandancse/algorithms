sorted array of n uniformly distributed values

uniformly distribution means gap between adjacent element is same

pos = low + [ ( (x-a[low])/(a[high] - a[low]) ) * (high - low) ]

if(a[pos] == x):
  return ok;
 
if(a[pos] > x):
  reassign values of low,high,a[low],a[high] and search in left half
 
else:
  reassign values of low,high,a[low],a[high] and search in right  half
  
  
  
  
  if uniformly distributed -->> O(log (log n))
  worst case -->O(n)
