Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.


If x, y and z are same, we can simply print any of them as common element and move ahead in all three arrays.
If x < y, we can move ahead in ar1[] as x cannot be a common element.
else If y < z, we can move ahead in ar2[] as y cannot be a common element.
else If x < y, we can move ahead in ar1[] as x cannot be a common element.
else if z < x and z < y we can move ahead in ar3[] as z cannot be a common element.
