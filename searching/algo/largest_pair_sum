This problem mainly boils down to finding the largest and second largest element in array. 
We can find the largest and second largest in O(n) time by traversing array once. 



1) Initialize both first and second largest
   first = max(arr[0], arr[1])
   second = min(arr[0], arr[1])
2) Loop through remaining elements (from 3rd to end)
   a) If the current element is greater than first, then update first 
       and second. 
   b) Else if the current element is greater than second then update 
    second
3) Return (first + second)
