given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. 
There are no duplicates in the list.
One of the integers is missing in the list. 
Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.


1) find sum of first n element i.e. n(n+1)/2
   Subtract all the numbers from sum and
   you will get the missing number



--->> integer overflow can occur

2) XOR all the array elements, let the result of XOR be X1.
   XOR all numbers from 1 to n, let XOR be X2.
   XOR of X1 and X2 gives the missing number.
