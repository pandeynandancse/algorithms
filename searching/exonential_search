Exponential search involves two steps:
    Find range where element is present
    Do Binary Search in above found range.

How to find the range where element may be present?
The idea is to start with subarray size 1, compare its last element with x, then try size 2, then 4 and so on until last element of a subarray is not greater.
Once we find an index i (after repeated doubling of i), we know that the element must be present between i/2 and i




Basically it is  a jump  with a exponential growth . and then do binary search .
