Given three numbers x, y and k, find the kâ€™th common factor of x and y. 
Print -1 if there are less than k common factors of x and y.


We find the smaller of two numbers as common factor cannot be greater than the smaller number. T
hen we run a loop from 1 to the smaller number. 
For every number i, we check if it is a common factor. 
If yes, we increment count of common factors.


int findKCF(int x, int y, int k) 
{ 
   // Find smaller of two numbers 
   int small = min(x, y); 
  
   // Count common factors until we either 
   // reach small or count becomes k. 
   int count = 1; 
   for (int i=2; i<=small; i++) 
   { 
      if (x % i==0 && y % i == 0) 
         count++; 
      if (count == k) 
         return i; 
   } 
  
   // If we reached small 
   return -1; 
}
