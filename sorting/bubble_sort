Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

BC - O(n) .Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
AC - O(n* n)
WC - O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Sorting in place : yes
Stable : yes
