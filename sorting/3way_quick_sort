The idea of 3 way QuickSort is to process all occurrences of pivot and is based on Dutch National Flag algorithm.



In 3 Way QuickSort, an array arr[l..r] is divided in 3 parts:
a) arr[l..i] elements less than pivot.
b) arr[i+1..j-1] elements equal to pivot.
c) arr[j..r] elements greater than pivot.
